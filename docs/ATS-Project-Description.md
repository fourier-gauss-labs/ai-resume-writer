# ATS for Candidates: Project Vision & Feature Roadmap

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an **Applicant Tracking System (ATS) for candidates** - a comprehensive job search platform that empowers job seekers with the same sophisticated tools that employers use to manage their hiring process. Instead of being tracked by employer systems, candidates take control of their job search with AI-powered tools that tailor applications, manage relationships, and optimize their entire job hunting workflow.

## Core Vision

The end result will be a system where users leverage AI to:
- **Tailor resumes and cover letters** to specific job opportunities based on their comprehensive profile
- **Track the entire job application process** from initial interest to final outcome
- **Manage relationships** with recruiters, hiring managers, and professional contacts
- **Gain market intelligence** to make strategic career decisions
- **Automate repetitive tasks** to focus on high-value activities
