# FirebaseError Resolution & Profile Setup Guide

## Problem Diagnosed ‚úÖ

The "FirebaseError: unknown" when regenerating the Baton job resume was caused by **empty or missing profile data** in Firebase. The error handling has been significantly improved to provide clear, actionable feedback.

## Enhanced Error Handling üõ†Ô∏è

### Before:
```
‚ùå FirebaseError: unknown
```

### After:
```
‚úÖ Failed to generate resume: Your profile appears to be empty.
   Please upload your resume or enter your information in Settings ‚Üí Profile to generate resumes.
```

## New Error Messages üìù

The system now provides specific guidance for different scenarios:

1. **Empty Profile**: "Your profile appears to be empty. Please upload your resume or enter your information in Settings ‚Üí Profile to generate resumes."

2. **Authentication Issues**: "Please log in to generate resumes"

3. **Permission Problems**: "Access denied. Please check your account permissions or try logging out and back in."

4. **Network Issues**: "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."

5. **Service Unavailable**: "Resume generation service is unavailable. Please try again later."

## How to Populate Your Profile üìã

To resolve the empty profile issue and generate quality resumes:

### Option 1: Upload Resume (Recommended)
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Profile** (or equivalent upload section)
