# AI Resume Parser Improvements

## Overview

Updated the AI parsing prompts to handle the broader range of document types described in the "Structured History Planning" document, while maintaining the exact same JSON output format required by the LinkedIn-style profile interface.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Content Type Detection

The parsing functions now recognize and adapt to different document types:

- **Plain contact files** - Simple lists of phone numbers and emails
- **Traditional resumes** - Standard formatted resumes with dedicated sections  
- **Narrative career journaling** - Rich stories about career experiences
- **Performance reviews** - Employee evaluations with achievements
- **LinkedIn exports** - Professional profiles with structured sections
- **Mixed content documents** - Files combining multiple information types

### 2. Improved Parsing Strategies

Each parsing function now applies appropriate strategies based on content type:

#### Contact Information Parser
- **Plain contact files**: Extracts all phones/emails even without explicit labels
- **Narrative content**: Scans stories for contact mentions anywhere in text
- **Traditional resumes**: Looks for contact sections and headers
- **Mixed documents**: Combines contact info from all relevant sources

#### Skills Parser
- **Traditional resumes**: Extracts from skills sections and work experience
- **Narrative content**: Mines technical skills from career stories and project descriptions
- **Performance reviews**: Identifies skills from feedback and assessments
- **Mixed documents**: Looks for tools, technologies, and methodologies mentioned throughout

#### Education Parser
- **Traditional resumes**: Processes education sections with structured data
- **Narrative content**: Finds degree mentions and educational experiences in stories
- **Mixed documents**: Looks for any references to schooling, training, or academic background

#### Certifications Parser
- **Traditional resumes**: Extracts from certification sections
- **Narrative content**: Identifies certifications mentioned in career progression stories
- **Performance reviews**: Finds training completed and credentials earned
- **Mixed documents**: Looks for any mention of certifications, licenses, or professional credentials

#### Job History Parser
- **Traditional resumes**: Processes work experience sections
- **Narrative content**: Extracts job details and accomplishments from career stories
- **Performance reviews**: Gets current role context and achievement descriptions
- **Project descriptions**: Extracts work context and accomplishments from project work

### 3. Maintained Data Compatibility

- All JSON output formats remain exactly the same
- Existing LinkedIn-style profile interface works unchanged
- Backend API contracts preserved
- Frontend components require no modifications

### 4. Enhanced Context Understanding

- Scans entire corpus rather than just traditional resume sections
- Recognizes informal language and narrative descriptions
- Extracts accomplishments from stories and performance feedback
- Combines information intelligently from multiple document sources
- Handles various date formats and contextual references
